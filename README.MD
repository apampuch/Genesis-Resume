# Genesis Resume

This is my resume written for the Sega Genesis using SGDK. It should run perfectly fine in any emulator or on actual hardware, though it hasn't been tested on real hardware yet due to my lack of a flashcart.

Backgrounds were taken from Pexels and "digitized" using Aseprite's Floyd-Steinberg Error Diffusion Dithering feature.

In the future I plan to add background music, I just don't think of myself as a terribly good composer.
